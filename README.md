Keep an eye on the status of Jamf Cloud with jamfStatus.  The app will place an icon in the menu bar to reflect the current cloud status.

<img src="./jamfStatus/images/menubar.png" alt="menu bar" width="200" />
<p>
An alert window will be displayed as the cloud status changes.  You can configure how the alert window display refreshes, either at every status check or only when the status changes.

For minor Jamf Cloud issues something similar to the following be displayed.

For major Jamf Cloud issues something similar to the following be displayed.

<img src="./jamfStatus/images/major.png" alt="alert" width="700" />

Access Preferences from the menu bar icon.  Here you'll be able to set the following:<br>
- Polling interval.<br>
- Whether the alert window is displayed at every polling interval or only when the status changes.<br>
- How the menubar icon is displayed.  Minimizing will place a thin transparent icon in the menubar.<br>
- Use of a LaunchAgent, to automatically start the app when logging in.<br>
- Information for your specific Jamf Cloud instance. The account used only needs to be able to authenticate, no need to assign permissions. If your cloud server does not utilize the HTTPS port 443 be sure to include the port you use in the URL.

There are two different menu bar icon styles to choose from.  One uses colors to indicate the status and the other uses slashes.<br><br>
            <div style="margin-left: 55px;">
               <table>
                  <tr>
                    <th>Status</th>
                    <td>minor</td>
                    <td>major</td>
                    <td>minor</td>
                    <td>major</td>
                  </tr>
                  <tr>
                    <th>Icon</th>
                    <td><img src="./jamfStatus/images/minor1.png" id="Image2" alt=""></th>
                     <td><img src="./jamfStatus/images/major1.png" id="Image2" alt=""></th>
                        <td><img src="./jamfStatus/images/minor2.png" id="Image2" alt=""></th>
                           <td><img src="./jamfStatus/images/major2.png" id="Image2" alt=""></th>
                  </tr>
                </table></div><br>
